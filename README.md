## Introduction

The Car Rental System is designed to simulate the basic operations of a car rental service. Users can browse through available cars, select a car to rent, and return it once the rental period is over. The system keeps track of rented and available cars and calculates the total rental cost based on the price per day and the number of days rented.

## Features

- **View Available Cars**: Display the name, model, and price per day of all available cars.
- **Rent a Car**: Select a car from the available options to rent for a specified period.
- **Return a Car**: Return a rented car, making it available for others to rent.
- **Calculate Rental Cost**: Calculate the total rental cost based on the price per day and rental duration.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used to build the application.
- **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction to organize the code.
